    - layers:
      - background: first layer to be rendered, just images
      - terrain: second layer to be rendered, contains terrain and all things that
                 are just rendered, they do nothing but to exist and be painted.
      - collision: contains logic rectangles (don't render them) only.
                   This rectangles define those parts of the map the player should
                   collide with (floor, platforms).
      - logic: random logic of the game goes here, such as:
            - player_start: circle logic
            - player_finish: circle logic
            - light: circle logic with:
                - size: vec2d (only x will be used)
            - camera_x_limit_right, camera_x_limit_left, camera_y_limit_top, camera_y_limit_bottom
      - death:
            - static enemies
            - death zones
      - light:
            - lights (circle logic with size custom property (vec2d with value in x))
            - obstructors (rectangles)
